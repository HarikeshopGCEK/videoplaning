# Splitting the Work & Work flow

***Building an Arduino library for school students which controls a obstacle avoidance bot with two Ultra Sonic Sensors at Left and Right. The project is a simple one and will improve the knowledge about OOP programming in C++ language. The project was in my (Harikesh) mind for a long time and figured it will be good my fellow team mates to know those stuff too. So I gave each task taking their knowledge in the field as criteria ***

| Name           | Task                                                                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Harikesh       | Gave everyone the initial idea and initialize the Project and help everyone |
| Anamika PP     | Create the function defenitions                                             |
| Adithya Raj KK | Documentation and README.md file                                            |
# About the project
*The file system will look like something below*

```plaintext
📁 obstacle_avoider_library
 ┣ 📁 examples
	┗ 📄 example.cpp
 ┣ 📁 test
 ┣ 📁 src
	┣ 📄 obstacle.cpp
	┗ 📄 obstalce.h
 ┣ 📄 library.json
 ┣ 📄 LICENSE
 ┗ 📄 README.md
```

1. The example folder contains the example code which utilizes the library
2. `obstacle.h` file contain the header file for the library
3. And the `obstacle.cpp` contain the function definitions
4. The created library will be published to platformio registry
